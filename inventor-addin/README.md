# SF Vault Bridge

Inventor 2026 add-in that lets the Vault MCP server work in Vault through
Inventor's signed-in session, so no second Vault licence seat is needed.
Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-12-inventor-vault-bridge-design.md`.

## Install (per Windows user, no admin)

1. Close Inventor.
2. `pwsh -File inventor-addin/Install-VaultBridge.ps1` (needs the .NET 8 SDK on the build PC).
3. Start Inventor and sign in to Vault.

## Check it

- Log: `%APPDATA%\Simplifyber\VaultBridge\bridge.log` should say `started 0.1.0 on http://localhost:8790/`.
- `py -3.14 -c "import sys; sys.path.insert(0, 'scripts'); import vault_bridge; print(vault_bridge.status())"`

## Uninstall

Close Inventor, then delete `%APPDATA%\Autodesk\ApplicationPlugins\SFVaultBridge` (DLLs and manifest) and
`%APPDATA%\Simplifyber\VaultBridge` (token and log). The bridge loads only in Inventor 2026.
